# Implementation Plan: Africa-Targeted E-Commerce Platform

**Branch**: `001-africa-targeted-e` | **Date**: September 7, 2025 | **Spec**: [/specs/001-africa-targeted-e/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-africa-targeted-e/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

- **Parallel Execution**: Mark [P] for independent tasks that can run simultaneously
- **African Market Priority**: Payment and localization features prioritized for market fit

**Task Distribution**:

- Foundation & Infrastructure: 8-10 tasks
- Backend Libraries & Services: 15-20 tasks [P]
- Frontend Components & PWA: 12-15 tasks [P]
- African Integrations: 10-12 tasks
- Testing & Optimization: 8-10 tasks
- **Total Estimated**: 50-65 numbered, prioritized tasks

**African Market Specific Considerations**:

- Mobile-first implementation prioritized over desktop
- Offline functionality built into every user-facing component
- Payment gateway integration includes SMS fallback mechanisms
- Multi-language support built from ground up, not retrofitted
- Performance optimization assumes 2G network conditions

**Constitution Compliance in Task Generation**:

- Every feature implemented as independent library with CLI
- Contract tests written first, implementation second
- Real database and payment gateway testing required
- Structured logging included in all services
- Breaking changes handled with API versioning

**Estimated Output**: 50-65 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md with [P] parallel markers

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan
