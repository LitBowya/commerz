# Feature Specification: Africa-Targeted E-Commerce Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-africa-targeted-e`  
**Created**: September 7, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Africa-Targeted E-Commerce Platform App - A comprehensive, mobile-optimized e-commerce platform designed specifically for the African market, enabling merchants to create customizable online stores with local payment gateways, AI-driven personalization, and social commerce integration to address market-specific challenges like limited internet access, trust deficits, and logistics issues."

## Market Context & Strategic Rationale

Africa's e-commerce sector represents a transformative opportunity valued at $43 billion in 2025, projected to reach $113 billion by 2029 with a 7.52% CAGR. The market serves over 518 million users driven by 60% smartphone penetration and a youthful demographic. However, significant challenges persist: 72% lack reliable internet access, 40% distrust online payments due to fraud concerns, and logistics inefficiencies inflate rural delivery costs by 50%.

Key opportunities include social commerce growth (16.2% CAGR to $9.43 billion by 2030), mobile money dominance (40% of transactions), and AfCFTA cross-border trade potential ($450 billion). The platform addresses these challenges by providing mobile-first, offline-capable solutions with local payment integration and trust-building features.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Small business owners across Africa can easily create professional online stores to sell their products locally and across borders, while customers can safely discover, purchase, and receive products through trusted local payment methods and delivery networks, all optimized for mobile devices and intermittent connectivity.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Merchant Onboarding & Store Creation:**

1. **Given** a new merchant with basic digital literacy, **When** they access the platform on their mobile device, **Then** they can complete store setup within 30 minutes using guided wizards and pre-designed African-themed templates
2. **Given** a merchant in a low-connectivity area, **When** internet connection drops during store setup, **Then** their progress is saved locally and syncs when connection resumes

**Product Management & Inventory:** 3. **Given** a merchant with physical inventory, **When** they add products using voice commands or camera scanning, **Then** AI generates product descriptions in local languages with appropriate pricing suggestions 4. **Given** a merchant selling across multiple channels, **When** they update inventory, **Then** stock levels sync in real-time across WhatsApp Business, Facebook Shop, and their online store

**Customer Shopping Experience:** 5. **Given** a customer browsing on a slow connection, **When** they navigate the store, **Then** pages load within 3 seconds using optimized images and progressive loading 6. **Given** a customer ready to purchase, **When** they proceed to checkout, **Then** they can pay using M-Pesa, MTN MoMo, or cash-on-delivery with transparent shipping costs from local carriers

**Cross-Border & B2B Trading:** 7. **Given** a merchant wanting to sell across African borders, **When** they enable international selling, **Then** the system automatically handles currency conversion, customs documentation, and AfCFTA trade preferences 8. **Given** a bulk buyer (farmer cooperative), **When** they request quotes for large quantities, **Then** the system facilitates B2B pricing negotiations and payment terms

### Edge Cases

- What happens when mobile money payment fails during checkout? → System holds order for 30 minutes with SMS retry options
- How does the system handle product disputes in areas with limited legal recourse? → Built-in mediation system with community reputation scoring
- What occurs during extended internet outages? → Offline mode allows continued browsing, cart management, and order queuing for later sync
- How are language barriers addressed for cross-border trade? → AI translation with cultural context for 90+ African languages
